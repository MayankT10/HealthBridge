# Symptom Checker

## Overview
The Symptom Checker is a web application designed to help users assess their health based on the symptoms they input. It provides suggestions for common symptoms, allows users to enter their symptoms, and utilizes an external API to deliver accurate assessments regarding their health status.

## Features
- **Symptom Input**: Users can enter their symptoms in a user-friendly input field.
- **Suggestions**: As users type, the application suggests common symptoms based on the letters entered.
- **Assessment**: The application interacts with an external API to provide detailed assessments on whether the user is safe or needs medical help.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React and Material-UI for a responsive and intuitive user experience.
